# PyRegexp
A tiny regular expression engine written in Python3

This module provides a simplified version of python's **re** library. It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and characters outside the US ASCII range.

The main purpose of this library is to show how re works internally. Have fun!
